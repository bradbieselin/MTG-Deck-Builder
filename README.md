MTG Deck Builder is a collaborative project that I worked on during the JavaScript phase of Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp. MTG Deck Builder allows you to search for any Magic: The Gathering card that exists. If you are unsure of the name of a card, the website will display the 20 best possible matches to your search. You can get more details of a card by clicking on it, and then you can add the card to your favorites list. Search for all the cards you want, add them to your favorites list and you can build any deck you'd like. The frontend was written entirely in vanilla JavaScript, and styled in vanilla CSS. We use the ScryFall API to display the cards you search for or add to your favorites list, and your favorites list is saved using a JSON Server. You can visit the site here.
